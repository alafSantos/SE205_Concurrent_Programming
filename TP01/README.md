## 1 Vector Reduction (vector_reduction)
* Aims: Reason about dependencies in programs with loops.

## 2 Vector Addition (vector_addition)
* Aims: Reason about dependencies and relate them to compiler optimizations.

## 3 Matrix Vector Product (matrix_vector_multiply)
* Aims: Reason about memory accesses in loops, vectorization, and cache performance.
